<h2>General information</h2>
<button class="accordion">
  What is the Medill-Northwestern Journalism Institute?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>
The institute, also known as “Medill cherubs,” is a five-week journalism program for rising high school seniors.  Students learn from accomplished journalists and Northwestern professors while gaining practical experience in the field.  By the end of the summer, students create a body of work, build connections and meet aspiring journalists from around the world.  High school journalists come to Evanston, Illinois, from all over the globe to join the cherubs.  In the summer of 2016, students represented 22 states in the U.S. and the District of Columbia, as well as China, Hong Kong, Mexico, and South Korea.

<button class="accordion">
  What is a “cherub?”
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>
It’s a nickname, meaning a celestial being (angel).  Students are traditionally known as “cherubs.”
</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">
  Who are the teachers?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>
The program has been run by Professor Roger Boye since 1985.  The rest of the staff is made up of professional journalists, educators, and Medill School of Journalism graduates, many of whom are cherub alumni.  Each student is assigned a specific instructor to be his or her mentor throughout the summer.  The instructors provide individual feedback and meet with the students personally on Saturday mornings.  Dorm life is supervised by community associates, who are rising sophomores at Medill and cherub alumni.  The CA’s also help lead some of the classes.

The weather will generally be warm, but be prepared for it to be unseasonably cool.  Bring several T-shirts and pairs of shorts, and a few pairs of long pants.  Add a jacket for some cool days and nights, and bring a raincoat and/or an umbrella for when it rains.  Sunscreen is also a must.  There is not much of a need for formal attire, but students will be better off having some just in case.  Having a laptop computer helps, but is not necessary, and it is important that students always keep track of their computers.  Bring pencils, pens, paper, headphones, a camera, a flash drive, and an audio recorder for journalistic purposes.
